This extension is supposed to stop that from happening. This project introduced me to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript; it would also jump start me in the world of web development and web apps.",

    "description": "After History AutoDelete, I wanted to port Self Destructing Cookies which I think is an amazing cookie policy for web browsers that compromises between privacy and convenience. This extension will delete all unused cookies on tab close. Unused means that if all google.com tabs are closed then google.com cookies are cleared. This helps people set what cookies they want to keep and then forget about it (meaning you don't have to micromanage it).",
