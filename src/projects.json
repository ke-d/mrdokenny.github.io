      "description": "An annoyance that I had with Google Maps was that every time I moved the map, it would spawn 3-4 history entries. So, after 5 minutes, I might have over 100 history entries. This extension is supposed to stop that from happening. This project introduced me to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript; it would also jump start me in the world of web development and web apps.",

      "description": "After History AutoDelete, I wanted to port Self Destructing Cookies which I think is an amazing cookie policy for web browsers that compromises between privacy and convenience. This extension will delete all unused cookies on tab close. Unused means that if all google.com tabs are closed then google.com cookies are cleared. This helps people set what cookies they want to keep and then forget about it (meaning you don't have to micromanage it).",

      "description": "Using a boilerplate as a starting point, I turned it into what you see here today. All this was from scratch using React Components and BootStrap, taking into inspiration of my old website which was a template. The result is a personal website with more modern components (React Framework and BootStrap 3 via React-BootStrap) and easier expandability (maybe a blog?). On the technical side, this site functions like a web app since all routes are lazy loaded in the background. So, when you enter a new route, it is loaded underneath without a browser page load. However, since the chunks for some routes were so small, I set up Webpack to automatically merge chunks to reach a minimum size to avoid multiple HTTP request per chunk.",
