All this was from scratch using React Components and BootStrap, taking into inspiration of my old website which was a template. The result is a personal website with more modern components (React Framework and BootStrap 4.0) and easier expandability (maybe a blog?). Also all routes are lazy loaded; so if this were a real app, it would be efficient.",
